# Axon cluster demo with Ansible

## Usage

### Preparations

Make 4 VMs, and put their IP addresses in the inventory file.
Ensure that these VMs have SSH running and use `ssh-copy-id` or a similar method to put your SSH public key on the servers. Ping the servers through Ansible to verify that everything is working in order.
